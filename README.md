# Portfolio Website - SheCodes Project

This project is a **Portfolio Website** created during my learning journey with [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/). The purpose of this project was to apply the concepts of **Bootstrap** to build a responsive and visually appealing website.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the website structure.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and enhancements.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design, layout, and pre-styled components.
